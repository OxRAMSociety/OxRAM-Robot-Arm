# OxRAM Robot Arm

This is a public repository gathering all the code and resources related to the OxRAM Robot Arm project.

The goal of the project is to build a robotic arm using open source, 3D printed parts. We are using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) as the software stack to program the arm. One of our targets it to attach a camera which can give the arm some autonomy via image processing and machine learning techniques.

As a first application, the arm will be able to play chess, being able to recognize and interact with a physical board and its chess pieces.

## Features

- The hardware design is based on the [BCN3D MOVEO](https://www.bcn3d.com/bcn3d-moveo-the-future-of-learning/) arm;
- [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) is used to power the software side of the arm;
- The arm will be capable of understanding (domain-specific) input voice commands;
- The arm will be capable of performing (domain-specific) object detection and recognition through a camera mounted on the gripper.
